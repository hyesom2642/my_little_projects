After Arturo's inspiring journey to a place where time seems to stands still, he and his orchestra join the masters of son jarocho at the border between the United States and Mexico for a son jarocho music and dance festival called Fandango Fronterizo (founded by Jorge Francisco Castillo). The festival takes place simultaneously on both sides of the United States\/Mexican border transforming this object that divides to one that unites. With a poetic musical approach inspired by the son jarocho tradition, Fandango at the Wall reveals a Mexico seldom depicted, and delves into the current mass human migrations spurred by violence, poverty, and corruption.","yt_trailer_code":"uFxHELPisVk","language":"en","mpa_rating":"","background_image":"https:\/\/yts.mx\/assets\/images\/movies\/fandango_at_the_wall_2020\/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https:\/\/yts.mx\/assets\/images\/movies\/fandango_at_the_wall_2020\/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https:\/\/yts.mx\/assets\/images\/movies\/fandango_at_the_wall_2020\/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https:\/\/yts.mx\/assets\/images\/movies\/fandango_at_the_wall_2020\/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https:\/\/yts.mx\/assets\/images\/movies\/fandango_at_the_wall_2020\/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https:\/\/yts.mx\/torrent\/download\/C68EFE60EDE5B287103A12302B02FD992174D459","hash":"C68EFE60EDE5B287103A12302B02FD992174D459","quality":"720p","type":"web","seeds":0,"peers":1,"size":"853.81 MB","size_bytes":895284675,"date_uploaded":"2020-09-29 04:48:53","date_uploaded_unix":1601347733},{"url":"https:\/\/yts.mx\/torrent\/download\/38C25F10D6FA3FF456DA14EF56F47A404E111583","hash":"38C25F10D6FA3FF456DA14EF56F47A404E111583","quality":"1080p","type":"web","seeds":1,"peers":0,"size":"1.71 GB","size_bytes":1836098519,"date_uploaded":"2020-09-29 06:32:02","date_uploaded_unix":1601353922}],"date_uploaded":"2020-09-29 04:48:53","date_uploaded_unix":1601347733},{"id":21870,"url":"https:\/\/yts.mx\/movies\/david-attenborough-a-life-on-our-planet-2020","imdb_code":"tt11989890","title":"David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet","title_english":"David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet","title_long":"David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet (2020)","slug":"david-attenborough-a-life-on-our-planet-2020","year":2020,"rating":9,"runtime":83,"genres":["Action","Biography","Documentary"],"summary":"One man has seen more of the natural world than any other.
